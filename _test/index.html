	<!-- start of header section: insert your logo, etc, here -->

	<p>
	Placeholder content for your header section. Replace it with your website's logo or name or page title or whatever.

	<div id="contproper">

	<h1>Welcome</h1>
	<p>
	Placeholder content. Replace everything here with your actual content.

	<p>
	If you want a navigation menu for your side column that looks like the one on thesitewizard.com,
	you can generate your own and customize it, with the
	<a href="https://www.thesitewizard.com/wizards/css-menu-buttons.shtml">Navigation Menu Wizard</a>.
	It's free, just like the <a href="https://www.thesitewizard.com/wizards/layout.shtml">Layout Wizard</a>
	that you used to create this.
	</p>
	<p>
	And if you want a contact form (ie, one that your visitors can use to reach you), go to the
	<a href="https://www.thesitewizard.com/wizards/feedbackform.shtml">Feedback Form Wizard</a>
	to create one. Yes, it's free too.
	</p>
	<p>
	Okay, that's it. I've run out of meaningful things to say for this placeholder content, and can't be bothered to
	think up any more stuff that you're just going to delete anyway.
	</p>
	<p>
	All the best for your site!
